# STATUS: 780M prefill campaign, round 2 (parameter space + beyond)

Updated 2026-10-04 13:40 PDT. Parent for this round: profile `780m-refine3` (build `topic-r1`).
Artifacts: `rocky-ryzen:~/hmz-sarc/.artifacts/780m-prefill-refine-2026-10-04/` (new raw data; moved there from a
private `/tmp` directory on 2026-10-04) and `.../780m-prefill-refine-2026-10-03/` (earlier builds and sessions).

## Running now

- Building the eleven sweep binaries (`tools/build_space.sh`, CPU only), then the parameter-space sweep starts
  detached (`tools/sweep_space.py`, results in `<artifacts>/raw/space/results.csv`). No e2e session is running.

## Done in this round

| step | session | result |
|---|---|---|
| baseline re-check, cool start (40 C) | `t1-recheck` | `dev/1.5` 2698.29 / 2544.10 (1B 4w / 8da4w), 1147.98 / 1043.30 (3B), 523.65 / 488.32 (8B) tok/s: within 0.8 % of `sarc-1.5-e2e-benchmark/results/cells.csv` (2698.29 / 2544.1, 1151.21 / 1051.33, 525.80 / 489.13). `780m-refine3` over `dev/1.5`: +4.98 / +11.19, +3.84 / +11.98, +3.99 / +12.44 %, geomean +8.00 %. The flagged 8B 4w cell, re-measured cool: **+3.99 %** (523.65 -> 544.54). Binaries of 2026-10-03, not rebuilt. |
| A/A, warm start | `t2-aa` (superseded) | started 90 s after the re-check (idle reference 44 C, run starts at 49 C): a warm-up, not used as the noise floor. Geomean +0.01 %, cells within +-0.14 %. |
| A/A, cool start (42 C, the idle temperature after 30 min) | `t3-aa` | **noise floor**: geomean +0.01 %, cells -0.23 to +0.19 %, repeat spread at most 0.52 %, clock 2797 to 2800 MHz, next token SAME in all cells on both prompts. Per cell (tok/s, 4w / 8da4w): 1B 2828.73 / 2828.73, 3B 1192.08 / 1172.97, 8B 544.10 / 549.50. |

## Part 1: parameter space (static count, `tools/enum_space.py`)

| family | combinations | device | flags | geometry | shared memory | shape | survivors | tile geometries |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4w | 75,497,472 | 64,487,424 | 10,515,456 | 292,692 | 76,188 | 0 | 125,712 | 590 |
| 8da4w zpg | 165,888 | 133,632 | 7,632 | 22,002 | 384 | 0 | 2,238 | 594 |
| SDPA QK^T | 9,216 | 3,840 | 0 | 2,832 | 820 | 0 | 1,724 | 628 |
| SDPA attn*V | 4,608 | 1,920 | 0 | 2,023 | 28 | 167 | 470 | 446 |

Columns "device" to "shape" count the combinations removed by each static rule, in that order.
The rules replay without a rejection on the 64 existing variants this device runs (`enum_space.py --check`).

Plan (`tools/plan_space.py`, 6,074 configurations in 11 builds; `results/780m/space/sweep-manifest.csv`):
8da4w (2,238), QK^T (1,724) and attn*V (470) in full; 4w in stages (A: each of the 590 geometries once, with the
surviving flag set closest to the shipped one, 586 + 4; B: every flag combination, 1,056, on the shipped tile, the
refine3 wide tile and their 2x2 / 2x4 grids; the measured top geometries of stage A follow as a second B plan).

Timing sample, 30 configurations drawn at random (`results/780m/space/sample30-results.csv`, 20:21 to 20:33 UTC):

| family | sample | s per configuration | planned | projected |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SDPA (one QK^T and one attn*V token per run: 8 correctness cases, then timing) | 10 runs, 20 tokens | 12.5 per run | 1,724 runs | 6.0 h |
| 8da4w | 10 | 15.8 | 2,238 | 9.8 h |
| 4w, staged | 10 | 18.4 (15.3 to 26.4) | 1,642 | 8.4 h |
| total | | | | 24.2 h, about 26 h with cooling waits and the 06:40 to 07:40 pause |
| 4w, all 125,712 survivors | | 18.4 | 125,712 | **642 h (26.8 days): over the 48 h limit, not started** |

The first sample is in `<artifacts>/superseded/sample30-kernel-name-not-recognised/`: the linear family names
lacked `linear_`, which the microbench needs to report the kernel time.

Found by the sample: `CSH_BAND` 4w tiles whose `SG_GRID_Y * 16 * WG_TILE_N * 2` reaches 64 KiB are refused by
the selector's shared-memory check (`impl/sarc/Select.cpp`, release zone; it does not know the band drain), so
they keep the table kernel and are recorded with `dispatched=0`.

Linear configurations are timed with the microbench's correctness gate off (the gate only knows the table
kernels' small shapes); correctness is checked in the repeat stage. SDPA configurations are checked in every run.

## Next

1. Sweep: SDPA batches b00 to b03, then 8da4w b03 to b07, then 4w b07 to b10.
2. Part 2 while the sweep runs (the sweep is paused during builds and e2e sessions): softmax variant
   `sarc_sdpa_attn_weights_softmax_780m_r1` behind `hooks/softmax-name-hook.patch` (release zone, not applied on
   the branch), measured through a scratch tree.
3. Repeat stage for the top 10 per shape, then the gated candidates.

## Blocking

Nothing. For the owner to decide later: whether the full 4w space (26.8 days) is wanted; the staged design covers
all geometries and all flag combinations, but not every geometry x flag pair.
